								<h2>Our Story</h2>
								<p>Amarillo is the central hub of life for the panhandle. With the rise of technology constantly expanding and transforming itself, it is difficult for smaller businesses to be able to deal with the upkeep of their information and documents. Digigalz LLC is a small business intended to help blue-collar businesses and workers transition from their physical files and upload them to a secure drive accessible to them at any request.</p>
								<p>Digigalz aims to bridge the gap between the past and present by digitizing and maintaining documents. We work together to preserve history, culture, education, and communities. Our service will satisfy the need for updating business files whenever there is not time or enough hands to do it. We step in to make sure businesses can keep up with the rapidly growing technology advances and not fall behind by being trapped in papers.
